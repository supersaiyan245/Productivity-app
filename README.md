# Project Overview

## Project Name

ProductiveMe

## Project Description

People can enter their to-do lists for the day or week and fun things they want to do for that day or week. When a certain number of things are completed, a fun to-do thing pops up and tells the person to go do it.

## API and Data Sample

Show us a snippet of JSON returned by your Airtable (you can find it under the API documentation) so we know you can access it and get the info you need. This __must__ be properly formatted. An example is below:

```json
{
    "records": [
        {
            "id": "recONRzIUTuZ5lXaF",
            "fields": {
                "author": "Liz Yrineo",
                "setup": "Why did the tomato turn red?",
                "punchline": "Because it saw the salad dressing!"
            },
            "createdTime": "2020-11-30T16:03:09.000Z"
        },
        {
            "id": "rec3oYZ5Tp0AIDsKe",
            "fields": {
                "author": "Rachel Moskowitz",
                "setup": "What did the green grape say to the red grape?",
                "punchline": "Breathe, idiot, breathe!"
            },
            "createdTime": "2020-11-30T16:03:09.000Z"
        },
        {
            "id": "recA34tOaoE1IVeC1",
            "fields": {
                "author": "Gary Grant",
                "setup": "How do you make holy water?",
                "punchline": "You boil the hell out of it!"
            },
            "createdTime": "2020-11-30T16:03:09.000Z"
        }
    ],
    "offset": "recA34tOaoE1IVeC1"
}
```

### MVP/PostMVP

The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MVP and PostMVP.  Carefully decide what is placed into your MVP, as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.  

#### MVP 
<li>Homepage updates the Chores, Errands, and Fun lists</li>
<li>Add Seperate APIs or Tables to hold lists
<li>Day of the current week and days of the current week are shown on Home, Chore, Errand, and Fun Pages</li>
<li>Fun lists sends an alert message to do a task after certain number of Chores and Errands lists are checked off</li>

#### PostMVP  

<li>Login Page for Users</li>

## Project Schedule

This schedule will be used to keep track of your progress throughout the week and align with our expectations. Here's an example.

|July 15| Initial Clickable Model  | Incomplete
|July 16| MVP | Incomplete
|July 17| Presentations | Incomplete

## Timeframes
